This is a list of information
Every row of the file is a new piece of data for the game
By changing what each line is, we can change how the game works
For example, each line could be the name of an enemy
Or, each line could be the stats for one enemy, with a different file for each enemy
Or, each line could be the name of a location in an adventure game
